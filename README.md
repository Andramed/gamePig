This is an interactive game for two players where each player takes turns rolling a die until they roll a one or press a "stop" button. 
If a player presses the "stop" button, their accumulated score is saved and the turn passes to the other player. If a player rolls a one, 
their current score is set to zero and their turn ends. The goal of the game is for a player to accumulate 100 points. The first player to 
reach this score is the winner.
